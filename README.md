# React Maze

I've done some node work in the past using express, but I thought I'd like
to give React a try.  I have a couple other implementations of a 3D maze,
but this one may be one of the more reasonable implementations so far.  It
isn't about reasonable though.

                                   /
                                  / 
    --+                          +  
      |\                        /|  
      | \                      / |  
      |  +                    +  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  +                    +  |  
      | /                      \ |  
      |/                        \|  
    --+                          +  
                                  \ 
                                   \

* npm install
