# React Maze

I've done some node work in the past using express, but I thought I'd like
to give React a try.  This application uses my Rails 3D Maze application
to get the Maze data through a REST interface.

                                   /
                                  / 
    --+                          +  
      |\                        /|  
      | \                      / |  
      |  +                    +  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |  
      |  |                    |  |
